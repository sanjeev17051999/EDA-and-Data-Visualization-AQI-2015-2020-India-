# EDA-and-Data-Visualization-AQI-2015-2020-India

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the air quality in India using the AQI India dataset. The dataset contains information about various air pollutants and their corresponding Air Quality Index (AQI) values for different cities in India. The project involves performing basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and creating several insightful visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in the data.

## Dataset
The AQI India dataset used in this project consists of the following columns:

- City: The name of the city.
- Date: The date of the air quality measurement.
- PM2.5: Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 micrometers or smaller.
- PM10: Particulate Matter (PM) 10 micrometers or smaller.
- NO: Nitric Oxide.
- NO2: Nitrogen Dioxide.
- NOx: Nitrogen Oxides.
- NH3: Ammonia.
- CO: Carbon Monoxide.
- SO2: Sulfur Dioxide.
- O3: Ozone.
- Benzene: Benzene concentration.
- Toluene: Toluene concentration.
- Xylene: Xylene concentration.
- AQI: Air Quality Index.
- AQI_Bucket: Air Quality Index category.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project involves conducting basic EDA on the AQI India dataset. Some of the key steps performed during the EDA process include:

1. Data Cleaning: The dataset is examined for missing values, duplicate entries, and any inconsistencies in the data.
2. Data Transformation: The 'Date' column is converted into a datetime format, and a new column 'Month' is extracted to analyze monthly trends.
3. Data Visualization: Several meaningful visualizations are created using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the dataset. These visualizations include line plots, box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, and more.

## Insights
The EDA and visualizations provide valuable insights into the air quality in India based on the AQI India dataset. Some of the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis include:

- Trends and fluctuations in PM2.5 levels over time.
- Distribution and variations in the Air Quality Index (AQI) across different cities and months.
- Comparison of AQI buckets and their counts.
- Relationships and correlations between various pollutants.
- Seasonal patterns and variations in pollutant levels.
- Mean AQI values and comparisons across cities.
